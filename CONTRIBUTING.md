# How to contribute
First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. I've tried to make a stable project and try to fix bugs continuously. You can help me do more.

## Getting started

### Reporting issues

Hop over to the [issues](https://github.com/HerrBertling/vue-blockies/issues) and open one if anything in this package is not working. Don't worry if you do not know how to fix something. We'll figure it out.

### Writing some code!

Contributing to a project on Github is pretty straight forward. If this is you're first time, these are the steps you should take.

- Fork this repo.

And that's it! Read the code available and change the part you don't like! Your change should not break the existing code, that would be awesome :smile:

If you're adding a new functionality, start from the branch **main**. It would be a good practice to create a new branch and work in there.

When you're done, submit a pull request, I'll check it out. I'll also let you know if there is any problem or any changes that should be considered.

### Tests

I haven't written any tests for this package yet. Feel free to do so :blush:

### Documentation

I did write some documentation for the package, but I haven't checked with anyone whether it is easy to understand. If you are confused by any part, feel free to open an issue and discuss potential clarifications.
